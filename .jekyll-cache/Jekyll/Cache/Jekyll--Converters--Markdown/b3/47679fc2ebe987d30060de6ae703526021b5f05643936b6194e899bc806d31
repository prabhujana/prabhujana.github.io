I"Š<h1 class="mx-auto" style="font-family:Courgette;">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at College of Computing &amp; Informatics, University of North Carolina - Charlotte, advised by Dr. Pu Wang.</p>

<p>My research is focused on developing machine learning solutions for communication networks, particularly wireless multi-hop networks. I am also actively working on privacy enabled AI/ML solutions including federated learning, mmWave based user identification and system-in-loop emulator for large scale wireless multi-hop federated learning. In previous research projects, I worked on cognitive radio networks and developed applications for USRP-E310, USRP N210 and HackRF.</p>

<p>Before starting my Ph.D, I obtained my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Anna University, Masters degree in Computer Networking from Wichita State University.</p>
